# create-next-quick

**create-next-quick** is a CLI tool that lets you instantly create a new Next.js project with your choice of options.

## Why create-next-quick?

`create-next-quick` is a lightweight and fast alternative to `create-next-app`. It provides an interactive setup process that lets you choose the options you want for your project, such as TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Next.js app directory. It also lets you create multiple pages at once, which can save you a lot of time when starting a new project.

## Features

- **CLI Argument for Project Name** â€” skip the project name prompt by passing the app name as a CLI argument.
- **Package Manager Detection** â€” automatically detects installed package managers (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) and only prompts with available options.
- **Next.js App Directory** â€” support for the new Next.js app directory.
- **Custom Page Generation** â€” create multiple pages at once.
- **Linter Support** â€” choose between no linter, ESLint, and Biome.
- **ORM Support** â€” choose between no ORM, Prisma, and Drizzle.
- **Shadcn UI** â€” automatically installs and configures Shadcn UI with a default style and color, **non-interactively**.
- **Robust Error Handling** â€” includes automatic retries for failed package installations, intelligent cleanup of incomplete projects, and clear, actionable troubleshooting tips for a smoother setup experience.
- **TypeScript CSS Module Support** â€” automatically generates a `global.d.ts` file to provide type declarations for CSS imports, resolving common TypeScript errors in Next.js projects.
- **Clean Project Setup** â€” removes default favicon and clears public folder.
- **Empty Default Page** â€” overwrites the default `page.tsx` or `index.tsx` with an empty template.
- **Dynamic Metadata** â€” always overwrites the `layout.tsx` or `layout.jsx` with a minimal template.
- **Conditional API Route Deletion** â€” deletes the default `api/hello.js` route if using the `src` directory and not the `app` directory.
- **Safe Project Creation** â€” checks if the current directory is empty when creating a project in the current directory (`.`) and prevents accidental overwrites.
- **Automated CI/CD Feedback** â€” Pull Requests now receive automated comments on test status.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** â€” `create-next-quick` requires Node.js version 18 or higher. Please ensure your Node.js environment meets this requirement.

## Installation

You donâ€™t need to install it globally â€” run it instantly with `npx`:

```bash
npx create-next-quick
```

## ðŸ›  Usage

You can run `npx create-next-quick` with or without a project name.

### With a Project Name

```bash
npx create-next-quick my-app
```

This will skip the project name prompt and create a new directory named `my-app`.

### Without a Project Name

```bash
npx create-next-quick
```

When you run `npx create-next-quick` without a project name, you will be prompted to:

1.  **Enter Project Name** â€” e.g., `my-app` (or `.` to create in the current directory). If you use `.` the directory must be empty.
2.  **Choose a package manager** â€” detects installed package managers (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) and prompts you to choose. **(Default: pnpm, logged to console)**
3.  **Choose to use TypeScript (default: Yes, logged to console)**
4.  **Choose to use Tailwind CSS (default: Yes, logged to console)**
5.  **Choose to use src directory (default: Yes, logged to console)**
6.  **Choose to use the app directory (default: Yes, logged to console)**
7.  **Enter the names of the pages you want to create (comma-separated, default: none, logged to console)**
8.  **Choose a linter (default: none, logged to console)**
9.  **Choose an ORM (default: none, logged to console)**
10. **Choose to use Shadcn UI (default: Yes, logged to console)****

Example run:

```bash
npx create-next-quick
```

## Testing

The test suite for `create-next-quick` is designed to be dynamic and data-driven. Test cases are automatically generated based on the available options in `index.js`, ensuring comprehensive coverage as the CLI evolves.

To run the tests:

1.  **Generate Test Cases:** First, generate the test cases by running:
    ```bash
    npm run test:generate
    ```
    This script parses `index.js` and creates `test/generated-test-cases.js`.
2.  **Run Tests:** Then, execute the test suite:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    This will run all generated test cases using Mocha.
