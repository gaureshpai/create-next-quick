# create-next-quick

**create-next-quick** is a CLI tool that lets you instantly create a new Next.js project with your choice of options.

## Why create-next-quick?

`create-next-quick` is a lightweight and fast alternative to `create-next-app`. It provides an interactive setup process that lets you choose the options you want for your project, such as TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Next.js app directory. It also lets you create multiple pages at once, which can save you a lot of time when starting a new project.

## Features

- **Package Manager Detection** â€” automatically detects installed package managers (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) and only prompts with available options.
- **Next.js App Directory** â€” support for the new Next.js app directory.
- **Custom Page Generation** â€” create multiple pages at once.
- **Linter Support** â€” choose between no linter, ESLint, and Biome.
- **Shadcn UI** â€” automatically install and configure Shadcn UI.
- **Clean Project Setup** â€” removes default favicon and clears public folder.
- **Empty Default Page** â€” overwrites the default `page.tsx` or `index.tsx` with an empty template.
- **Dynamic Metadata** â€” always overwrites the `layout.tsx` or `layout.jsx` with a minimal template.
- **Conditional API Route Deletion** â€” deletes the default `api/hello.js` route if using the `src` directory and not the `app` directory.
- **Flexible Project Naming** â€” allows using `.` to create the project in the current directory.
- **ORM Support** â€” choose between no ORM, Prisma, and Drizzle.
